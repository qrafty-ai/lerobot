## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Treat PI-RL as online RL extension path.
- [Init]: Integrate incrementally in LeRobot runtime instead of full RLinf runtime replacement.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Need phase-level implementation planning for PI-RL recipe hooks over flow-matching policy interfaces (XVLA first).
