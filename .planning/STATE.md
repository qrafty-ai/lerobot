# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-21)

**Core value:** Enable reliable online RL fine-tuning of flow-based VLA policies in LeRobot while preserving existing RL stability and operability.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - PI-RL Recipe Foundation

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Treat PI-RL as online RL extension path.
- [Init]: Integrate incrementally in LeRobot runtime instead of full RLinf runtime replacement.
- [Update]: Use LIBERO benchmark as default simulation-first validation path for PI-RL milestones.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Need explicit acceptance thresholds for LIBERO per-suite/average metrics for Phase 3 sign-off.
